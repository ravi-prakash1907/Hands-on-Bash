The Reality
-----------

The scenes come closer, as the sight goes far ;
The scrumptious faces, tend to have ugly scars..

The feet loose strength, can’t move any more ;
Tho’ verdicts move in deep, very deep up to core..

The truth’s kept hidden, beneath a fine dusky skin ;
That pellucid pall itself pores, stories of era of sin..

The time stands still, seeing truth miles away ;
While, men search’em, at a place that’s phony..

Future wanna come today, but past never leaves ;
In clutter of these two, men spoil present’s peace..

The ego, within one, is a long lasting wizard ;
Once, it got settled, settle all ugly scars..!!!
